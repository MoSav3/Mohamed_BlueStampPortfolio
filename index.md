Gesture controlled robot
Imagine commanding a robot with just a wave of your handâ€”no buttons, no remotes, just pure intuitive control. This robot turns your gestures into an extraordinary interactive experience.

For my third and final milestone, I connected the accelerometer to the Arduino micro allowing for the controller to detect gestures. My biggest challenge was the coding aspect due to my lack of experience; my greatest triumph was honestly finishing the main project a couple of days before demo night despite having a couple of challenges. The key topics I learned were the importance of learning how to communicate with an audience as well as learning more about different types of engineering. I hope that I learn what it takes to create something truly innovative in the future. 


# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, I got both Bluetooth to connect. I had to ensure a stable connection and follow the correct wiring layouts for the Micro and Uno Bluetooth. What has been surprising is building this car showed me how powerful coding is. Before this program, I always viewed coding as something that's only associated with software, however, now I know that coding makes machines move. This process was smooth and there weren't any obstacles I faced. My next step is to get the accelerometer to work which would be the final step for building the gesture-controlled robot

  For my first milestone, I'm working on getting the motors working. This project is a robotic car controlled by hand gestures. This project involves integrating DC motors, an H-Bridge for motor direction control, an Arduino Uno R3 for signal processing, and a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with a controller. So far, I've successfully set up the Arduino and H-Bridge, and I've made progress in programming basic motor functions. However, my main challenge was coding because I had no prior experience. Moving forward, my plan is to focus on getting the Bluetooth module operational to establish communication between the controller and the robot. 


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
